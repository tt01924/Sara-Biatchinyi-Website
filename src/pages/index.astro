							<p class="content-title">Introduction: Contextualising Decolonisation </p>
							<p>In 2020, a global dialogue and introspection about structural racism, lack of equality, and limited diversity and inclusion in society were ushered by the 2020 Black Lives Matter movement. In many ways, it has been a revolutionary year for persons of African descent and those who support their plight. It has given people the power to demand for what they need. Decolonisation is a necessary element of true integration. Decolonisation as a term is defined as “the process in which a country that was previously a colony (controlled by another country) becomes politically independent”. Based on this definition, decolonisation has already been achieved. Unfortunately, the 1 implications of colonisation are so deeply ingrained in today's societies that it is difficult to believe that political independence can be equivalent to total independence for many countries. Decolonisation must extend beyond geography to mindset, aesthetics, and what is valued (and what is not).</p><p> This thesis focuses on decolonising design in Africa. It will examine the challenges faced and how decolonising design is essential to integrating and validating Africa's design on a global scale. The importance of decolonising design is essential for African designers to develop, while simultaneously not being held at a western standard. For this thesis, the concept of decolonisation will heavily focus on the role of western society and the suppression it exerts on African designers to succeed. The lack of space and equity for African designers in the design world is deafening. The political climate of 2020 pressurised institutions and private industries to evaluate their status and discuss decolonisation publicly. But what does decolonisation mean for them? The interpretation of this word can lead to performative action: employing more Persons Of Color (POC); making public statements in support of BLM on social media, or claiming that their mission statement has been adjusted to promote anti-racism. These actions can easily lead to empty promises, with no actual implementation of decolonisation.</p>
