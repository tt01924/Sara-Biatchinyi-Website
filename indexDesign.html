        <p>Alongside Aika Cherdabayeva, we developed a visionary platform concept with the purpose of overcoming boundaries that often alienate young artists and designers from non-white, cis, male environments. This platform serves as a space to create a directory of talented creatives from underrepresented communities, promoting inclusivity and providing them with greater visibility.</p>
